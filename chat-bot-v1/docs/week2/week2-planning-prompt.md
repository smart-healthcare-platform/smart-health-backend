# Week 2: Rule Engine Implementation - Planning Prompt

## üéØ Week 2 Overview
**Focus**: Design and implement a robust Rule Engine for medical emergency scenarios
**Timeline**: 5 days (Monday - Friday)
**Primary Goal**: Create a rule-based system that can handle medical urgency detection and appropriate response routing

## üìã Week Objectives
1. Design Rule Engine architecture and schema
2. Implement core rule processing engine
3. Develop medical emergency rule sets
4. Integrate with existing Chatbot Service
5. Implement comprehensive testing and optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Rule Engine Architecture
- **Type**: Forward-chaining rule engine
- **Language**: JavaScript/Node.js
- **Storage**: MySQL for rule definitions, Redis for runtime caching
- **Performance**: < 100ms response time per rule evaluation

### Rule Types to Support
1. **Medical Urgency Detection**: Chest pain, breathing difficulties, etc.
2. **Response Routing**: Emergency services, doctor consultation, self-care
3. **Language Handling**: Multi-language support for rules
4. **Context Awareness**: Session-based rule execution

## üìù Implementation Tasks

### Day 1: Architecture & Design
- [ ] Design rule engine data model and schema
- [ ] Define rule DSL (Domain Specific Language)
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Setup project structure for rule engine

### Day 2: Core Engine Implementation  
- [ ] Implement rule parser and compiler
- [ ] Create rule execution engine
- [ ] Add rule validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement basic rule testing framework

### Day 3: Medical Rule Sets
- [ ] Develop emergency medical rules (chest pain, breathing issues)
- [ ] Create urgency classification rules
- [ ] Implement response routing logic
- [ ] Add multi-language rule support

### Day 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate rule engine with chat service
- [ ] Create API endpoints for rule management
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

### Day 5: Optimization & Documentation
- [ ] Implement rule caching mechanism
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create documentation and examples
- [ ] Final testing and deployment preparation

## üéØ Success Criteria
- Rule engine processes medical scenarios within 100ms
- Supports at least 50 different medical rules
- Integration with existing chat service complete
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Documentation complete with examples

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Implement rule compilation and caching
- **Accuracy**: Medical expert validation for all rules
- **Complexity**: Start with simple rules, iterate based on feedback
- **Integration**: Thorough testing with existing services

## üìä Metrics to Track
- Rule execution time (P95 < 100ms)
- Rule accuracy rate (>95% for test cases)
- System availability (99.9% uptime)
- Error rate (<1% of requests)

## üîó Dependencies
- Week 1 completion (chat service, database, Redis)
- Ollama integration for AI fallback
- Medical expertise for rule validation
- Testing infrastructure setup
